# Estimating-Safety-Parameters-of-Traffic-Scenarios-using-Probabilistic-Programming-Languages
Ongoing

Deep Learning models have been widely used in the domain of self-driving cars. One of the major challenges in this domain is generation of real data. We resort to synthetic data generation in this regard. The other important aspect in self-driving cars is safety. Inclusion of AI and ML techniques in self-driven cars open doors for various concerns relating to safety. A lot of works in the AI domain are in transit concerning the safety of these self driven cars. We propose methodologies to leverage the advantages of probabilistic programming languages to infer the distributions of various features extracted from self-driven car simulations to learn the safety of these driving scenarios. Simulation of various cars on predefined synthetically generated roadmap has been done to identify data coming from various sensors which we take as safety features. We resort to Pyro as our Probabilistic Programming Language to learn the inference of the safety features and finally we plot them. Finally, the plot shows the population distribution of the safety features by only considering the sample data.
